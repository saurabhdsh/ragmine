Ragmine - CLI RAG-Based Agent Framework

Welcome to Ragmine, a powerful CLI-based agent framework preconfigured with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. Ragmine streamlines document analysis and knowledge retrieval through easy integration with databases, models, and prompts. 

## Features

- Database Flexibility**: Connect to external databases like MongoDB or use the inbuilt ChromaDB.
- Document Parsing**: Accepts documents in PDF format for semantic processing.
- Model Selection**: Choose from multiple supported LLMs, including OpenAI's models, LLaMA, and more.
- Interactive Prompts**: Ask questions based on your documents and get precise, context-aware answers.
- Effortless CLI Workflow**: Seamlessly guide users through database selection, document input, model configuration, and prompt interaction.
